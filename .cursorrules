# Cursor Rules f√ºr AI Gateway Design-System

## Design-System Integration
Always read and follow: /design/tokens.json, /design/components.md, /design/layout.md
Enforce: No hardcoded hex colors; use design tokens from /design/tokens.json
Accessibility: Follow /design/a11y.md; include keyboard focus and ARIA attributes
Performance: Respect /design/perf.md budgets and guidelines

## Code Style & Architecture
Use existing Tailwind config with design token integration
Prefer shadcn/ui primitives over custom components
Follow TypeScript best practices with strict typing
Use absolute imports with @/ prefix

## UI/UX Guidelines
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Consistent spacing using design token values
- Professional, clean appearance without garish colors
- Intuitive workflow-logical UI with good supporting features
- Accessibility-first approach with proper ARIA labels

## Component Standards
- Use Radix UI primitives through shadcn/ui
- Include proper loading, empty, and error states
- Implement proper form validation with inline errors
- Use consistent motion durations (150ms, 250ms, 350ms)
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion user preference

## White-Labeling Support
- Use branding configuration from /lib/branding.ts
- Implement CSS variables for easy customization
- Support both light and dark themes
- Make all text content configurable
- Use placeholder text format: ***[Platzhalter: Beschreibung]***

## Testing Requirements
- Include Playwright E2E tests for complex interactions
- Test accessibility with keyboard navigation
- Verify responsive behavior across breakpoints
- Test with reduced motion preferences

## File Organization
- Place components in appropriate feature directories
- Use consistent naming: kebab-case for files, PascalCase for components
- Group related functionality together
- Maintain clear separation of concerns

## Performance Standards
- LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1
- Bundle size < 150KB initial, < 50KB per route
- Implement proper code splitting and lazy loading
- Optimize images and use Next.js Image component

## Accessibility Requirements
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Proper contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text)
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Focus management and visible focus indicators
